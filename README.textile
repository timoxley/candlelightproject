h3. TODO:

 * Convert node image to 9patch (instead of bitmap drawable)(For pretty graphics)
 * Integrate MapNode.java and Node.java in some sensible manner
 * Switch to more able Gesture recognition class
 * Handle gestures to allow connecting & drawing of node interconnections, allow entering of 'edit mode'
 * Consider adding a 'toolbar' or just one icon for adding nodes, change 'click on background' to scroll around the graph

 * Maybe add a 'click' sound each time something is done
 * Allow text of node to be edited. Decide on how to handle scrolling etc
